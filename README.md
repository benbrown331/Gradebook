# Gradebook
 
 I used this project as a way to learn more about the different features of Java, and gain experience with SQL and AWS
 
 This program is intended to allow a professor to create a gradebook, and keep track of it with SQL.
 The SQL database is stored with AWS servers. Every new grade should update in the SQL database.
